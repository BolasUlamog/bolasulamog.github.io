    <h1>We are nearing the end of this CTF and I wanted to end it very gooey</h1>
    <p>Like a chocolate cookie</p>
    <p>I still think about this; I think about all the writings you've given me. And read them over and over again because they make me smile. </p>
    <p>So this CTF is just a fill in the blank to something I used to playfully tease you about (the inclination thing lol) a long time ago: </p>
    <p>This inclination to kiss you and hold your face and look into your eyes. We already do that a lot. Looking into each other's eyes.</p>
    <p>Somehow there is an urge to announce to everyone that you're mine but I don't want to assert some sort of ownership over you and neither do I want you to do to me.</p>
    <p> I just want you, that's all.</p>
    <p>I want to spend my whole life with you.</p>
    <p>It's so funny why I feel this way, I don't know. This is so strange how suddenly you fell into my life.</p>
    <p>You're in my veins. Liquidy and ____.</p>
