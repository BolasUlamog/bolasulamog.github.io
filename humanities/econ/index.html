        <summary>PPC and basic stuff (Unit 1)</summary>
        <p>Scarcity: Unlimited Wants but limited resources</p>
        <p>Oppurtunity Cost: Most desirable alternative given up when you make a choice</p>
        <p>Factors of production: Land, labor, capital (Machines and tools), entrepreneurship (Take the previous 3 and produce results)</p>
        <p>Production possibilities curve (PPC): Shows the different maximum combinations of producing two different goods using all of your fixed resources</p>
        <img src="ppc.png" alt="Production Possibilities Curve" width="300">
        <p>Constant oppurunity cost is linear slope, increasing oppurtunity cost is concave down</p>
        <p>Shifts in or out with the quality/quantity of resources!</p>
        <p>Absolute Advantage: The producer that can produce the most output or requires the least amount of resources</p>
        <p>Comparative Advtange: The producer with the lowest oppurtunity cost</p>
        <p>The opportunity cost of \(\text{A is }\frac{\text{cost for a unit of A}}{\text{cost for a unit of B}}\)</p>
        <p>For output (like PPCs), the opporunity cost of \(\text{A is }\frac{\text{B}}{\text{A}}\)</p>
        <p>Countries should specialize in the product where they can a lower oppurunity cost</p>
        <p>Mutually benefical terms of trade: The agreed upon conditions that would benefit both countries</p>
        <p><strong>The terms of trade for a good will fall between the two opportunity costs!</strong></p>
        <p>If they trade within this range it benefits both parties</p>

        <summary>Demand Supply graphs (Unit 1)</summary>
        <p><strong>Demand and supply:</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Demand: There is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded</p>
        <p><strong>Price changes quantity demanded, not demand!</strong></p>
        <p>Demand shifters: </p>
        <p>1. Tastes and preferences</p>
        <p>2. Market Size</p>
        <p>3. Prices of related goods (substitutes and compliments)</p>
        <p>4. Changes in income (Normal goods: More income=buy more product, Inferior goods: More income=buy less product)</p>
        <p>5. Expectations for the future</p>
        <p>Supply: There is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied</p>
        <p>Supply shifters:</p>
        <p>1. Input prices (prices of resources)</p>
        <p>2. Government tools (taxes, subsidies, regulations)</p>
        <p>3. Number of sellers</p>
        <p>4. Technology</p>
        <p>5. Producer Expectations</p>
        <p><strong>Equilibrium: </strong></p>
        <img src="dscurve.jpg" alt="Supply and Demand" width="300">
        <p>Single Shifts: Either demand goes up/down or supply goes up/down</p>

        <summary>Economic Indicators (Unit 2)</summary>
        <p>Circular flow model:</p> 
        <img src="flowmodel.png" alt="Circular Flow Model" width="300">
        <p>But the U.S. isn't a free market economy: </p>
        <img src="img15.png" alt="Circular Flow Model with Government" width="300">
        <p>Private Sector: Part of the economy that is run by individuals and businesses</p>
        <p>Public Sector: Part of the economy that is controlled by the government</p>
        <p>Factor Payments: Payments for the factors of production (rent, wages, interest, profit)</p>
        <p>Transfer Payments: The government redistributing income (social security, welfare, etc.)</p>
        <p>Subsidies: Government payments to businesses so they can produce more</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>GDP (Unit 2)</summary>
        <p>GDP: The dollar value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in one year</p>
        <p>GDP per capita is just GDP per person in that country</p>
        <p>Percent change in gdp: \(\frac{Y2-Y1}{Y1}\cdot{100}\)</p>
        <p>What is not counted in GDP?</p>
        <p>1. Intermediate goods (goods used to make final goods)</p>
        <p>2. Non-production transactions (stocks, bonds, real estate, old cars, used clothes)</p>
        <p>3. Non-market and illegal activities (Unpaid work, black markets, etc.)</p>
        <p>GDP = Consumer Spending + Government Spending + Investment Spending (Business spending of physical capital or change in inventories) + NET Exports</p>
        <p>GDP = \(C+I+G+(X-M)\) OR</p>
        <p>GDP = Rent + Wages + Interest + Profit (This comes from adding the income made from all final goods and services produced in a year)</p>
        <p>Nominal vs. Real GDP: Real GDP adjusts for inflation (so its the best measure)</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary> Unemployment (Unit 2)</summary>
        <p>Unemployed person: A person actively looking for a job but aren't working</p>
        <p>Unemployment rate: The percent of people in the labor force who want a job but are not working</p>
        <p>Labor force: The number of people aged 16+ that are willing/able to work (not in school/jail)</p>
        <p>Labor force participation rate: The percent of population in the labor force</p>
        <p>The 3 types of unemployment</p>
        <p>1. Frictional: Between jobs, qualified workers with transferable skills (includes seasonal)</p>
        <p>2. Structural: Changes to the labor force and tech make some jobs useless or skills obsolete. Workers must learn new skills</p>
        <p>3. Cyclical: Unemployment caused from a recession (AD goes down so less labor force is needed) (Caused by the business cycle)</p>
        <p>Natural Rate of Unemployment: Frictional + Structural (Around 5% in the US)</p>
        <p>Full Employment (Y): The rGDP when there is no cylical unemployment</p>
        <p> Possible reasons for misdiagnosis of unemployment rate:</p>
        <p>1. Discouraged workers (given up looking for a job so NOT in the laber force)</p>
        <p>2. Part time workers </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Inflation (Unit 2)</summary>
        <p>Inflation: When money loses its purchasing power (or a general increase in prices throughout the economy)</p>
        <p>Unexpected inflation helps borrowers, but <strong>hurts</strong> lenders and people on fixed income</p>
        <p>Nominal Wages: Wages based on dollars</p>
        <p>Real Wages: Wages based on purchasing power (adjusted for inflation)</p>
        <p>Real interest rates: The percentage increase in purchasing power that a borrower pays. (Adjusted for inflation)</p>
        <p>Real = nominal interest rate - expected inflation</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>The Consumer Price Index (CPI)</strong></p>
        <p>\(\text{CPI}=\frac{\text{Price of Market Basket}}{\text{Price of Market Basket in Base Year}}\cdot100\)</p>
        <p>The base year is given an index of 100 (obviously)</p>
        <p><strong>How do we use this?</strong></p>
        <p>\(\text{Inflation Rate}=\frac{\text{New CPI}-\text{Old CPI}}{\text{Old CPI}}\cdot100\)</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>GDP Deflator</strong></p>
        <p>\(\text{GDP Deflator} = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}}\cdot100\)</p>
        <p>The GDP Deflator measures the prices of all goods produced. The CPI only measures prices of goods and services bought by consumers.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Consider the following chart: </p>
        <img src="calculating gdp.png" alt="GDP Chart" width="300">
        <p>\(\text{2010 Nominal GDP}=100\cdot50+2000\cdot4=13000\)</p>
        <p>\(\text{2020 Nominal GDP}=75\cdot75+3000\cdot5=20625\)</p>
        <p>\(\text{2020 rGDP (using 2010 as a base year)}=75\cdot50+3000\cdot4=15750\)</p>
        <p>Now we can use this to calculate the GPA Deflator:</p>
        <p>\(\text{GDP Deflator}=\frac{20625}{15750}\cdot100=130.92\)</p>
        <p><strong>How do we use this?</strong></p>
        <p>1. Converting Nominal to Real GDP: \(\text{Real GDP} = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{GDP Deflator}}\cdot100\)</p>
        <p><strong>The 3 causes of inflation: </strong></p>
        <p>1. The government prints too much money</p>
        <p>\(MV=PY=\text{Nominal GDP}\) (Quantity theory of money)</p>
        <p>V, the velocity of money (the average amount of times a dollar is spent and respent in a year)</p>
        <p>P, the price level</p>
        <p>Y, the real GDP</p>
        <p>M, the Money Supply</p>
        <p>2. Demand Pull inflation:</p>
        <p>Demand pulls up prices (An overheated economy with excessive spending and few goods)</p>
        <p>3. Cost Push Inflation:</p>
        <p>Higher Production costs increase prices</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>The business cycle (unit 2)</summary>
        <p>3 goals for each economy: Promote economic growth, limit unemployment, keep prices stable</p>
        <p>1. Economic growth (Measured by rGDP)</p>
        <p>2. Full unemployment (The Natural Rate of unemployment (Frictional + Structural))</p>
        <p>3. Stable prices (Measured by GDP Deflator or CPI)</p>
        <p>These are hard to achieve because of the business cycle: </p>
        <img src="cycle.png" alt="Business Cycle" width="300">
        <p>A positive slope on the potential output shows <strong>economic growth</strong></p>
        <p>Expansions: When the economy is on the increase</p>
        <p>Contractions: When the economy is on the decrease</p>
        <p>Peak (high point): Unemployment is low, inflation is usually high</p>
        <p>Trough (low point): Unemployment is high, inflation is usually low</p>
        <p>Inflationary Gap: rGDP is above potential output</p>
        <p>Recessionary Gap: rGDP is below potential output</p>
        <p>A recession is a 6 month period of decline in rGDP. </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Multipliers (Unit 3)</summary>
        <p>Consumers have disposible income (Personal income - taxes) (Can spend or save)</p>
        <p>Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC): The percentage of disposible income that is spent</p>
        <p>Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS): The percentage of disposible income that is saved</p>
        <p><strong>How does this ripple through the economy?</strong> (Heres an example in which MPC=0.8 for each person)</p>
        <img src="rippleeffect.png" alt="Multiplier Effect" width="300">
        <p>You buy a boat for 800$, boat shop owner buys a bike for $640, etc.</p>
        <p>So how much can this impact GDP?</p>
        <p>Spending Multiplier = \(\frac{1}{\text{MPS}}=\frac{1}{1-\text{MPC}}\)</p>
        <p>So for the bike example, \(\text{Spending Multiplier}=\frac{1}{0.2}=5\) so $800 in spending could lead to $4000 dollar increase in GDP</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>The Tax Multiplier: </strong>When the government increases/decreases taxes, it changes the amount of disposible income. </p>
        <p>Tax Multiplier \(=-\frac{\text{MPC}}{MPS}=-\frac{\text{MPC}}{1-MPC}\)</p>
        <p>For the bike example, the tax multiplier is \(-\frac{0.8}{0.2}=-4\)</p>
        <p>So if the government lowered taxes by 20 million dollars, there would be a maximum GDP increase of 80 million dollars.</p>

    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Aggregate Demand and Supply (Unit 3)</summary>
        <p>Aggregate Demand: All the goods and services (rGDP) people are willing to buy at different price levels</p>
        <p><strong>The Demand for everything by everyone in the USA</strong></p>
        <img src="ad.png" alt="Aggregate Demand Curve" width="300">
        <p>Why is AD downwards sloping?</p>
        <p>1. The Wealth Effect: Higher price levels reduce the purchasing power of money. And so less expenditures happen. </p>
        <p>2. Interest Rate Effect: When PL increases, lenders need to charge more interest to get a real return which discourages consumer spending + business investment</p>
        <p>3. Foreign Trade Effect: When U.S. PL goes up, foreign powers buy less U.S. goods</p>
        <p><strong>What are the shifters?</strong></p>
        <p>1. Any change in \(C, I, G, \text{or } X_n\)</p>
        <p>Aggregate Supply: Production of all firms in the economy</p>
        <img src="sraslras.jpg" alt="Aggregate Supply Curve" width="300">
        <p>In the long run, the same exact quantity will be produced no matter the price level. (Full employment GDP)</p>
        <p>Both the short and long run aggregate supply curves can shift!</p>
        <p><strong>SRAS Shifters: </strong></p>
        <p>1. Price of resources</p>
        <p>2. Technology/Productivity</p>
        <p>3. Government regulations/taxes/subsidies</p>
        <p>5. Inflation Expectation</p>
        <p><strong>LRAS Shifters:</strong></p>
        <p>1. Quantity of Resources</p>
        <p>2. Quality of Resources</p>
        <p>3. Productivity</p>
        <p>4. Technology</p>
        <p>*Anything that shifts the PPC inwards shifts the LRAS to the left and vice versa!</p>
        <p><strong>Economy at full employment!</strong></p>
        <img src="equilibrium.jpg" alt="Economy At Full Employment" width="300">
        <p>Recessionary Gap: Actual rGDP is less than potential rGDP (the equilibrium is to the left of LRAS)</p>
        <p>Inflationary Gap: Actual rGDP is greater than potential rGDP (the equilibrium is to the right of LRAS)</p>
        <p>Demand-Pull Inflation: Prices go up due to an increase in AD</p>
        <img src="demandpull.jpg" alt="Demand-Pull Inflation" width="300">
        <p>Stagflation (Cost-Push inflation): Negative SRAS Shock (This is a recessionary gap)</p>
        <img src="costpush.png" alt="Cost-Push Inflation" width="300">
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Long Run Adjustments</strong> (some examples)</p>
        <p>1. Consumers want more stuff -> AD shifts right -> Inflationary Gap (in the short run)</p>
        <p>In the long run, wages then go up -> cost of firms go up -> SRAS shifts left -> PL increases</p>
        <img src="ex1.png" alt="Long Run Adjustments" width="300">
        <p>2. For a recessionary gap the opposite will happen and overall PL decreases</p>
        <p><strong>Long run adjustment is different than economic growth!</strong></p>
        <p>Economic growth: The idea of rGDP going up in the long run</p>
        <p>This can be created by an increase in investment: (What happens?)</p>
        <p>More capital -> AD shifts right, less production costs -> SRAS shifts right, PPC moves outwards -> LRAS shifts right</p>

        <summary>Discretionary Fiscal Policy and Automatic Stabalizers (Unit 3)</summary>
        <p>Sometimes it is faster to enact fiscal policy (government intervention) than to wait for the economy to self-correct.</p>
        <p>Expansionary fiscal policy: fights unemployment by: increasing government spending and/or decreasing taxes</p>
        <img src="Expansionary.png" alt="Expansionary Fiscal Policy" width="300">
        <p>This will increase budget deficit or surplus but will restore to long run eq. </p>
        <img src="Contractionary.png" alt="Contractionary Fiscal Policy" width="300">
        <p>Contractionary fiscal policy: fights inflation by: decreasing government spending and/or increasing taxes</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Automatic Stabilizers:</strong> Limit the flucuations of the business cycle</p>
        <p>Budget Defecit: Decrease during expansions and increase during contractions</p>
        <p>1. Taxes (Based off income): Increase during expansions and decrease during contractions</p>
        <p>2. Transfer Payment (like unemployment compensation): Decrease during expansions (fewer people are unemployed) and increase during contractions</p>

        <summary>Financial Assets and Money (Unit 4)</summary>
        <p><strong>Types of financial assets:</strong></p>
        <p>1. Stocks: Certificates for ownership of a corporation</p>
        <p>2. Bonds: Certificate that gives the owner the right to be paid back for a loan to a business or the government</p>
        <p>*Inverse relationship between the price of bonds and the interest rate</p>
        <p>3. Money: Most liquid asset</p>
        <p><strong>Money is...</strong></p>
        <p>1. A medium of exchange (can be used to buy goods and services)</p>
        <p>2. A unit of account/standard of value (It can be used to measure relative values)</p>
        <p>3. Store of value: If I work really hard today, the value of my work will be stored and will keep their value</p>
        <p><strong>How do we measure the money supply?</strong></p>
        <p>1. \(M_0\) (Monetary Base): Bank Reserves (not money) and Currency (money)</p>
        <p>2. \(M_1\) (Money that is usable as a medium of exchange): Currency, checkable depsits (CDs), and Savings Deposits</p>
        <p>3. \(M_2\) (Money and Near Money): All of \(M_1\) plus small time deposits and money market</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Real vs. Nominal Rates of Change (Unit 4)</summary>
        <p>The difference between the two is the inflation rate, which can be found with the Fischer Formula. </p>
        <p><strong>The Fischer Formula: </strong></p>
        <p>\(i\approx{r}+\pi\)</p>
        <p>\(i\): The nominal interest rate</p>
        <p>\(r\): The real interest rate</p>
        <p>\(\pi\): The inflation rate</p>
        <p>Sometimes the actual rate of inflation is different than the expected rate of inflation. </p>
        <p>Borrowers are helped because they pay a lower <strong>real</strong> interest rate!</p>
        <p>Lenders are hurt because they get paid a lower <strong>real</strong> interest rate!</p>
        <p><strong>How can you use the Fischer Formula to understand the difference between rates of change?</strong></p>

        <summary>Banking and the Money Supply (Unit 4)</summary>
        <p><strong>What are bank balance sheets?</strong></p>
        <img src="bank.png" alt="Bank Balance Sheet" width="300">
        <p><strong>Required Reserves</strong>: Percentage of checkable (demand) deposits set by the federal reserve</p>
        <p><strong>Excess Reserves</strong>: Excess money the bank can loan out after required reserves</p>
        <p>Assets = Liabilities</p>
        <p>Now assume there is a 100$ checking account desposit with a 10% reserve requirement. 10% go towards required reserves, so the bank has 90$ it can loan out. </p>
        <p><strong>The Money Multiplier</strong>: How many dollars worth of new loans, deposits, and money can be created from excess reserves</p>
        <img src="bankmultiplier.png" alt="Money Multiplier" width="300">
        <p>The total amount of money created is the sum of the "LOANS" column</p>
        <p>This is found using a geometric series: \(\sum\text{LOANS}=\sum{L_1\cdot(1-\text{RR})^n}=L_1\cdot\frac{1}{\text{RR}}\)</p>
        <p>The money multiplier uses a L-value (initial loan) of 1</p>
        <p>So the money "created" out of 100$ with a 10% Reserve requirment is \(90$\cdot\frac{1}{0.1}=900$\)</p>
        <p>The amount of new loans is \(90$\cdot10=900$\) </p>
        <p>Total amount of deposits is \(90$\cdot10+100$=1000$\)</p>
        <p><strong>The Money Multiplier shows us the MAXIMUM amounts of loans that can be created from excess reserves</strong></p>
        <p>However, numbers are much lower because of leakages:</p>
        <p>1. Many banks will hold excess requirements</p>
        <p>2. Consumers will hold onto cash (rather than depositing money)</p>

        <p><strong>Money Demand: </strong></p>
        <p>*Nominal interest rate is the opportunity cost of holding money!</p>
        <p>SO...as nominal interest rate increases people demand fewer dollars and when interest rates fall, the quantity of money increases!</p>
        <p><strong>Shifters of the Money Demand Curve</strong>: </p>
        <p>1. Asset Demand for Money: Desire to hold wealth as money instead of other assets</p>
        <p>2. Transaction Demand for Money: \(\text{GDP}=C+I+G+X_n\) and price level</p>
        <p><strong>Money Supply</strong>:</p>
        <p>1. Determined by the actions of the central bank when resources are scarce</p>
        <p>No relationship between the nominal interest rate and Quantity of Money</p>
        <p>2. The central bank can shift by supplying more/less money</p>

        <summary>Monetary Policy (Unit 4)</summary>
        <p><strong>Monetary Policy:</strong> How can banks target interest rates to move the economy around? (Fight inflation and unemployment)</p>
        <p>1. <strong>Scarce Reserves</strong>: </p>
        <p>Uses the money market to target interest rates</p>
        <p>3 tools:</p>
        <p>1. Open Market Operations: Buying and selling government bonds</p>
        <p>2. Discount Rate: Interest Rate the central bank charges banks</p>
        <p>3. Reserve Requirement: Percentage of checkable deposits</p>
        <p>These are used to influence policy rate (interest rate that banks charge each other)</p>
        <p><strong>Actions of the central bank can multiply through the economy </strong>(Monetary policy impacted by money multiplier)</p>
        <p>2. <strong>Ample Reserves</strong>: </p>
        <p>Uses the reserves market graph to target interest rates (Used by the Federal Reserve)</p>
        <p>The Reseves Market Graph: </p>
        <p>The demand of reserves:</p>
        <img src="reservesmarketdemand.png" alt="Reserves Market Graph" width="300">
        <p>The lower bound portion moves up and down depending on the interest on reserves rate. </p>
        <p>The supply of reserves: (This is determined by actions of the central bank)</p>
        <img src="reservesmarketsupply.png" alt="Reserves Market Graph" width="300">
        <p>When the supply curve intersects the downward sloping portion of the demand curve, we have scarce reserves. </p>
        <p>*If scarce, changes in reserves increase/decrease Policy Rate (PR)</p>
        <p>When the supply curve intersects the flat portion at the bottom, we have ample reserves</p>
        <p>*Must use different policy tools: </p>
        <p>1. Open Market Operations (buying/selling bonds to increase/decrease supply of reserves)</p>
        <p>Buying reserves shifts the supply of reserves to the right, which can be used to maintain an ample reserve</p>
        <p>2. Changes in administered rates</p>
        <p>Moves the demand curve: The upper flat portion changes with discount rate, the lower flat portion changes with <strong>Interest on Reserves</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Consider the economy shown below in a recessionary gap. The government can use expansionary monetary policy to fight the unemployment.</strong></p>
        <img src="rgap.png" alt="Expansionary Monetary Policy" width="300">
        <p>How can the government fix this?</p>
        <p>The government wants to decrease interest rates in order to increase AD to get back to full employment (more consumer spending)</p>
        <p>If they have scarce reserves...</p>
        <p>They do this by increase the money supply by: buying bonds, lowering the discount rate, lowering the reserve requirement</p>
        <img src="expandpolicy.png" alt="Expansionary Monetary Policy" width="300">
        <p>If they have ample reserves...</p>
        <p>They can do this by decreasing the interest on reserves, (or interest on reserves AND the discount rate (Called decreasing administered rates))</p>
        <img src="expandpolicy2.png" alt="Expansionary Monetary Policy" width="300">
        <p>Governments do the opposite for contractionary monetary policy (fighting off inflation)</p>

        <summary>The Loanable Funds Graph (Unit 4)</summary>
        <p>This is the demand and supply for long-term loans/investments</p>
        <p>y axis is real interest rate, x axis is Quantity of Loanable Funds</p>
        <img src="loanablefunds.jpg" alt="Loanable Funds Graph" width="300">
        <p>Demand Curve is the demand by businesses for gross investment</p>
        <p><strong>Shifters in demand</strong>: (Anything that impacts profit potential for investments)</p>
        <p>1. Changes in economic outlook</p>
        <p>2. Investment tax credits</p>
        <p><strong>Supply Curve</strong> (Savings supply): Money saved by households and avaliable for loans</p>
        <p><strong>Shifters in supply</strong>: </p>
        <p>1. Changes in disposible income</p>
        <p>2. Economic Outlook</p>
        <p>3. Foreign Investment (When foreign investors put money in our market by saving in the U.S.)</p>
        <p><strong>Crowding Out:</strong> An increase in the government deficit will increase interest rates and reduce investment.</p>
        <p>This can be graphed as either in increase in investment demand (government is demanding loans) or a decrease in supply (there are less loans avaliable to businesses)</p>

        <summary>Policy Consequences (Unit 5)</summary>
        <p>What are the long term consequences of monetary and fiscal policy actions?</p>
        <p><strong>Interactions between monetary and fiscal policy</strong></p>
        <p>Expansionary MP and Expansionary FP: Both increase AD</p>
        <img src="empfp.png" alt="Expansionary Policy x 2" width="300">
        <p>AD: Shifts right, PL: Increase, rGDP: Increase, unemployment: Decrease</p>
        <p>What about interest rates?</p>
        <p>Monetary Policy gives us a <strong>lower</strong> interest rate!</p>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">
            <img src="monetaryinf.png" alt="Expansionary Policy x 2" width="300">
            <img src="monetaryinf2.png" alt="Expansionary Policy x 2" width="300">
        </div>
        <p>For scarce systems, an increase in the money supply -> lower nominal interest</p>
        <p>For ample systems, a decrease on the interest on reserves rate decreases policy rate.</p>
        <p>However, fiscal policy gives us a <strong>higher</strong> interest rate!</p>
        <img src="monetaryinf3.png" alt="Expansionary Policy" width="300">
        <p>This is because taxes are lowered, which increases government debt so they want to take out loans!</p>
        <p>Overall, Interest Rates are <strong>Indeterminant</strong>, Gross Investment is <strong>Indeterminant</strong>, Economic Growth is <strong>Indeterminant</strong>!</p>
        <p>Contractionary MP and Expansionary FP: </p>
        <img src="monetaryinf4.png" alt="Contractionary MP and Expansionary FP" width="300">
        <p>AD: Indeterminant, PL: Indeterminant, rGDP: Indeterminant, Unemployment: Indeterminant</p>
        <p>What about interest rates?</p>
        <p>Monetary policy gives us a <strong>higher</strong> interest rate!</p>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">

            <img src="monetaryinf6.png" alt="Contractionary MP and Expansionary FP" width="300">
        </div>
        <p>For scarce systems, a decrease in the money supply -> higher nominal interest</p>
        <p>For ample systems, an increase on the interest on reserves rate increases policy rate.</p>
        <p>Fiscal Policy also gives us a <strong>higher</strong> interest rate! (as shown earlier)</p>
        <p>Overall, Interest Rates <strong>increase</strong>, Gross Investments <strong>decrease</strong>, and Economic Growth <strong>decreases</strong>.</p>
