        <summary>PPC and basic stuff (Unit 1)</summary>
        <p>Scarcity: Unlimited Wants but limited resources</p>
        <p>Oppurtunity Cost: Most desirable alternative given up when you make a choice</p>
        <p>Factors of production: Land, labor, capital</p>
        <p>Production possibilities curve: Shows the different combinations of producing two different goods using all of your resources</p>
        <img src="ppc.png" alt="Production Possibilities Curve" width="300">
        <p>Constant oppurunity cost is linear slope, increasing oppurtunity cost is concave down</p>
        <p>Absolute Advantage: The producer that can produce the most output or requires the least amount of resources</p>
        <p>Comparative Advtange: The producer with the lowest oppurtunity cost</p>
        <p>Countries should specialize in the product where they can a lower oppurunity cost</p>
        <p>Terms of trade: The agreed upon conditions that would benefit both countries</p>
    </details>

        <summary>Economic Systems (Unit 1)</summary>
        <p>Circular flow model:</p>
        <img src="flowmodel.png" alt="Circular Flow Model" width="300">
        <p>Private Sector: Part of the economy that is run by individuals and businesses</p>
        <p>Public Sector: Part of the economy that is controlled by the government</p>
        <p>Factor Payments: Payments for the factors of production (rent, wages, interest, profit)</p>
        <p>Transfer Payments: The government redistributing income (social security, welfare, etc.)</p>
        <p>Subsidies: Government payments to businesses so they can produce more</p>
        <p><strong>Demand and supply:</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Demand: There is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded</p>
        <p>Supply: There is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied</p>
        <img src="dscurve.jpg" alt="Supply and Demand" width="300">
        <p>Single Shifts: Either demand goes up/down or supply goes up/down</p>
    </details>

        <summary>Macro Measures (GDP) (Unit 2)</summary>
        <p>3 goals for each economy: Promote economic growth, limit unemployment, keep prices stable</p>
        <p>GDP: The dollar value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in one year</p>
        <p>GDP per capita is just GDP per person in that country</p>
        <p>Percent change in gdp: \(\frac{Y2-Y1}{Y1}\cdot{100}\)</p>
        <p>What is not counted in GDP?</p>
        <p>1. Intermediate goods (goods used to make final goods)</p>
        <p>2. Non-production transactions (stocks, bonds, real estate, old cars, used clothes)</p>
        <p>3. Non-market and illegal activities (Unpaid work, black markets, etc.)</p>
        <p>GDP = Consumer Spending + Government Spending + Investment Spending (Business spending) + NET Exports</p>
        <p>GDP = \(C+I+G+(X-M)\) OR</p>
        <p>GDP = Rent + Wages + Interest + Profit (This comes from adding the income made from all final goods and services produced in a year)</p>
        <p>Nominal vs. Real GDP: Real GDP adjusts for inflation (so its the best measure)</p>
        <p>The business cycle:</p>
        <img src="cycle.png" alt="Business Cycle" width="300">
        <p>A recession is a 6 month period of decline in rGDP. </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary> Unemployment (Unit 2)</summary>
        <p>Unemployed person: A person actively looking for a job but aren't working</p>
        <p>Unemployment rate: The percent of people in the labor force who want a job but are not working</p>
        <p>Labor force: The number of people aged 16+ that are willing/able to work (not in school/jail)</p>
        <p>Labor force participation rate: The percent of population in the labor force</p>
        <p>The 3 types of unemployment</p>
        <p>1. Frictional: Between jobs, qualified workers with transferable skills (includes seasonal)</p>
        <p>2. Structural: Changes to the labor force and tech make some jobs useless or skills obsolete. Workers must learn new skills</p>
        <p>3. Cyclical: Unemployment caused from a recession (AD goes down so less labor force is needed)</p>
        <p>Natural Rate of Unemployment: Frictional + Structural (Around 5% in the US)</p>
        <p>Full Employment (Y): The rGDP when there is no cylical unemployment</p>
        <p> Possible reasons for misdiagnosis of unemployment rate:</p>
        <p>1. Discouraged workers (given up looking for a job)</p>
        <p>2. Part time workers </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Keeping prices stable (Unit 2)</summary>
        <p>Inflation: When money loses its purchasing power</p>
        <p>Unexpected inflation helps borrowers, but <strong>hurts</strong> lenders and people on fixed income</p>
        <p>Nominal Wages: Wages based on dollars</p>
        <p>Real Wages: Wages based on purchasing power (adjusted for inflation)</p>
        <p>Real interest rates: The percentage increase in purchasing power that a borrower pays. (Adjusted for inflation)</p>
        <p>Real = nominal interest rate - expected inflation</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>The Consumer Price Index (CPI)</strong></p>
        <p>\(\text{CPI}=\frac{\text{Price of Market Basket}}{\text{Price of Market Basket in Base Year}}\cdot100\)</p>
        <p>The base year is given an index of 100 (obviously)</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>GDP Deflator</strong></p>
        <p>GDP Deflator = \(\frac{Nominal GDP}{Real GDP}\cdot100\)</p>
        <p>The GDP Deflator measures the prices of all goods produced. The CPI only measures prices of goods and services bought by consumers.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>The 3 causes of inflation: </strong></p>
        <p>1. The government prints too much money</p>
        <p>\(MV=PY=\text{Nominal GDP}\)</p>
        <p>V, the velocity of money (the average amount of times a dollar is spent and respent in a year)</p>
        <p>P, the price level</p>
        <p>Y, the real GDP</p>
        <p>M, the Money Supply</p>
