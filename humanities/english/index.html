            Pretty luster
            It was a 
            shiny doorknob a cool desmos graph that went
            twinkle 
            and a click of a button and creative urge

            Simple luster coated 
            on a hole so dark and deep
            it gave it that whitish color like a 
            rotting tooth after a filling

            Of course it chews just fine 
            bright as a peony pink gums
            pretty smile
            some shit facade

            Pretty luster
            consumed zealously
            now it’s dead 
            and you almost hope to hear 
            gasping 
            breaths

            but there is another
            twinkle

            That pungent smell of rotten copper
            Shards gleaming back the sun only slightly
            It was a whetted blade forged
            By an absence of salty sweat
            And the presence of that rose-canary viscous liquid
            And the sadism of its wielders

            it once stood
            In a matter almost indefatigably
            Bright in the masked sun
            Whitish bubbles of salty sea corrosive but unchanging to its flesh
            They lapped at it like soft tongues 

            And before that it was a dazzling star
            Its hot, naked self exposed to chill reality
            It is cruel tender prickly 
            But bulbous sweet sap oozing
            You take a bite 

            And say yum
            Forgetting the sorrow all you think about is 
            Its saccharine taste
            But not sugarcoated

            Up on the moonlit branch
            She was like a butterfly
            Effulgent wings broke the haze of stormy clouds
            But chains spread from snowy branches
            A skiff of snow that children hold out their tongues to
            It was so soft

            But it was so cold
            Stuck to that branch
            The ice swallowed her feet
            But like the old titan’s plan
            It falls to no avail as his children 
            gain freedom from that accursed belly

            Up on the moonlit branch
            Yellows and greens and reds broke the horizon
            And she sailed free 
            A droplet of water
