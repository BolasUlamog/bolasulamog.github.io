        <h1>Math 61 - Table of Contents</h1>
        <p>This is the first part of a theoretical (i.e., proof-based) sequence in multivariable calculus and linear algebra, providing a unified treatment of these topics. Covers general vector spaces, linear maps and duality, eigenvalues, inner product spaces, spectral theorem, metric spaces, differentiation in Euclidean space, submanifolds of Euclidean space as local graphs, integration on Euclidean space, and many examples. The linear algebra content is covered jointly with Math 61DM.</p>
