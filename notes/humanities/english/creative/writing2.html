        <div class="school">Stanford Roommate Essay</div>
        <div class="word-count">250 words</div>
        <div class="prompt">
            "Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate—and us—get to know you better."
        </div>
        <div class="essay-content">
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDear roommate,</p>
            <p>I hope this note reaches you well. And while this letter is supposed to help you get to know me better, my personality is something that I find difficult to summarize in a block of prose. But I say the rest of this letter with full confidence. Life is hard. There will always be something in life that will make you crawl in a ball and hide. Whether it's your mom dying, or getting a sub-par grade in a course, or getting rejected by some girl, there’ll always be people that support you. And I hope I will be able to support you and call me a friend. I’m not perfect, obviously, and I’ve had my share of trauma, being beaten by my dad, experiencing homelessness, and watching my rabbit mauled right before my eyes, and feeling her warm blood soak through my sweatshirt. I know more than anyone how important it is for people to be there for you. </p>
            <p>And regarding my hobbies, which I hope we share some (or eventually get to), I have quite a few. But when I do something, I don’t do it halfheartedly. I play the clarinet and practice everyday. I love math and physics, play tennis, and referee soccer. I enjoy snowboarding, mountain biking, and chess, and when it comes to video games, Brawl Stars and Minecraft are my top picks. I really hope we can learn a lot from each other and always be there for each other. </p>


Sincerely, Damian.
