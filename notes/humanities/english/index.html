        <div class="title">High School Graduation Speech</div>
        <div class="date">June 7, 2025</div>
        <div class="prose">
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe typical mundane high school experience is something clearly absent from this school’s student body. It is absent among those who pursue extracurriculars and their passions to the point they could have a linkedIn bubbling with more than the average college student. It is absent from those that spend weekends drifting golf carts and going on late night beach and hiking trips. It is absent from those that eat during class just so they can skip lunch and work on their differentials homework or scroll aops or talk politics with teachers instead of socializing. There is a level of support between the staff and students that simply doesn’t exist at other schools. This sense of camaraderie comes with a sort of transformative factor. It changes people from a tightly closed flower and allows them to blossom into a magnolia that stands out not among a field of grass but among a field of peonies and roses and hydrangeas. 
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen I first went into high school I definitely wasn’t what one might call a “social butterfly”. I found myself standing still. My legs felt like they were encased in layers of thick mud while others around me frolicked around in large cliches that seemed to form out of thin air. Not that I minded playing chess or doing math or whatever else I did during lunch with the one or two friends that I had. But the actions of others forced me to turn away my disposition of solitude and recognize the importance of networking and social interaction on a variety of fronts—not just school. It was healthy to goof around every once in a while still having a strong commitment to academics and community service. It taught me that a firm tug of the wrist is all people sometimes need to become a better version of themselves.
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo I want to end this speech with a sort of prompted push towards my peers and supporters to—and this is put simply—not lose that beautiful quality of being a scintillating, guiding light for all around you. Keep supporting peers that are going through hard times. Whether it's over a failed test or a loss of a loved one or just one of those off-days. Be that roommate that they can talk to instead of the one that makes them think “I don’t wanna go back to my dorm”. Be the person that others know they can show themselves in a vulnerable state around and know they won’t be judged. But I know you can do that. Because you did it for me. Thank you. 
            </p>

            Pretty luster
            It was a 
            shiny doorknob a cool desmos graph that went
            twinkle 
            and a click of a button and creative urge

            Simple luster coated 
            on a hole so dark and deep
            it gave it that whitish color like a 
            rotting tooth after a filling

            Of course it chews just fine 
            bright as a peony pink gums
            pretty smile
            some shit facade

            Pretty luster
            consumed zealously
            now it’s dead 
            and you almost hope to hear 
            gasping 
            breaths

            but there is another
            twinkle

            That pungent smell of rotten copper
            Shards gleaming back the sun only slightly
            It was a whetted blade forged
            By an absence of salty sweat
            And the presence of that rose-canary viscous liquid
            And the sadism of its wielders

            it once stood
            In a matter almost indefatigably
            Bright in the masked sun
            Whitish bubbles of salty sea corrosive but unchanging to its flesh
            They lapped at it like soft tongues 

            And before that it was a dazzling star
            Its hot, naked self exposed to chill reality
            It is cruel tender prickly 
            But bulbous sweet sap oozing
            You take a bite 

            And say yum
            Forgetting the sorrow all you think about is 
            Its saccharine taste
            But not sugarcoated

            Up on the moonlit branch
            She was like a butterfly
            Effulgent wings broke the haze of stormy clouds
            But chains spread from snowy branches
            A skiff of snow that children hold out their tongues to
            It was so soft

            But it was so cold
            Stuck to that branch
            The ice swallowed her feet
            But like the old titan’s plan
            It falls to no avail as his children 
            gain freedom from that accursed belly

            Up on the moonlit branch
            Yellows and greens and reds broke the horizon
            And she sailed free 
            A droplet of water

        <div class="prose">
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThat rusty, iron taste of blood was addicting to him. He dragged his tongue across fat, chapped lips and he bit down on them, hard. Vicious cherry beads were quickly lapped up. 
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo everyone else, everything was fine, but a ghastly torrent was eating him up from the inside. It was relentless, and even his own mother stood on her own island of solitary bliss. The bright sun caressed his skin until it started to burn. He stood up and walked to the shop of some stonemason of whom had moved to his village fairly recently.
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe was a grouchy old man, but Mario held him in the highest esteem. But Mario’s awkward social skills made it hard to talk to him. He ended up staring at the stonemason for a solid five minutes, then leaving without another word. 
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMario did this frequently. He was young, and told himself it was just a method for him discovering the world and learning more about himself. The old man had seemed to find annoyance in Mario’s presence at first, but later became slightly happy with it. 
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMario loved soup. Maybe instead of the taste of blood it was just that texture. Maybe he just enjoyed warm liquid falling down the sides of mouth as a result of his multitude of flaws. His mother called him to eat but it wasn’t soup today, just these chicken-egg calzone things. Their shape reminded him of the shells he used to collect when he was younger when they lived far away, closer to the beach. It made him feel this nostalgic feeling. It was hard to place. 
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe food was good, as usual, but those feelings didn’t go away. He went to his room and cried silent, dry tears. Maybe as a stigma of his masculinity tears of salt were the one warm liquid he couldn’t allow to dribble down his cheeks, unless they were the result of another person’s pain. This was something he resolved to hide within himself. 
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBut now he felt bad because he hadn’t finished the calzone, instead storming up to his room in what he thought of to himself as an immature episode stemming from his growing depression. He walked back down but the calzone was gone. His mother must have fallen asleep. 
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt was getting late, and Mario’s eyes were heavy. He asked himself why he was doing this but he had long since realized those types of questions were fruitless. But the continuous echo of the blacksmith’s hammer was gone. Mario didn’t exercise much, so his feet hurt as he increased his pace. The cold air offered an enveloping embrace to his hot starchy breath. 
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHis eyes must have been deceiving him though, because for the first time the stonemason looked at him it was with those same blank eyes. He didn’t know how it happened…but he knew he wouldn’t be coming back to visit the shop with the charred concrete steps and the strangely bright candy-red roof tiles for at least a while. His cries left his mind as a scream but left his mouth as all but a silent rasp. He walked down the steps and left.
